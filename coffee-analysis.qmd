## Introduction

This dataset has coffee ratings from around the world. I want to see which countries produce the highest rated coffee by looking at the total cupping scores.

## Data Loading
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

coffee <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2020/2020-07-07/coffee_ratings.csv')
country_ratings <- coffee |>
  filter(!is.na(total_cup_points))|>
  group_by(country_of_origin) |>
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(total_cup_points),
            count = n()) |>
  filter(count >= 5) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_rating)) |>
  head(10)

ggplot(country_ratings, aes(x = reorder(country_of_origin, avg_rating), y = avg_rating)) +
  geom_col(fill = "brown") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Countries by Average Coffee Rating",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Average Rating")
